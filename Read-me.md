# Pycalcul is my first project in my python programming adventure. Me and my college @rares9301 started small but we will try to implement as many features as possible. 
How to download:
1. Install python on yout computer (python 3.10 or higher)
2. Open cmd or powershell
3. Run the command : pip install pycalcul
4. Locate the installation folder (you can type the command from step 3 again and it will show you exactly where it is located)
5. Enjoy your new python calculator that i hope by the time someone actually reads this has a graphical interface :)

If u notice any bugs or weird prints from pycalcul don't hesitate to message me on discord at LOLpotatoe#1068 or email me and victorstefaniusco@gmail.com.
